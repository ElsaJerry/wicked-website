                    <p>Capturing the lived realities of WIC participants and staff through thoughtful, accessible surveys that prioritize ease and authenticity</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <p>As the starting component of data collection, we designed a survey to capture the lived realities of WIC participants and staff. With real experiences at the center, we believe surveys can bring depth and urgency to data by proposing open-ended, story-driven questions. Staying true to our principle of <span class="highlight">Ease</span>, surveys are more inclusive and a familiar approach for gaining input.</p>
                    
                    <p>The strength of this survey lies in its seamless introduction across the WIC participant and staff member journey. It's there in moments over the course of their experience with WIC, unobtrusive and low-burden.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Survey Journey Touchpoints</h3>
                <p>Let's walk through the survey touchpoints to see how the whole experience maps out:</p>

                        <div class="step-number">1</div>
                        <h4>Appointment Reminders</h4>
                        <p>Ahead of her scheduled WIC appointment, a participant receives a reminder from the clinic. Embedded within the reminder is a short, inviting message: <em>"Tap this secure link to share your WIC experience‚Äîit takes just 10 minutes and helps us serve you better."</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The keyword <strong>secure</strong> brings assurance of safety</li>
                            <li>A single tap brings the participant directly to the mobile-friendly survey, with no need to log in or download anything</li>
                            <li>Some local agencies do these reminders either by text message or email‚Äîboth work just as well</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="journey-step">
                        <div class="step-number">2</div>
                        <h4>Staff Invitation</h4>
                        <p>Once the participants come into the appointment‚Äîwhether in-person or virtual‚Äîa WIC staff member briefly explains the survey (<em>"Your input really helps us improve WIC. Would you like to take a quick survey before you leave?"</em>).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The staff member can share the link via text, email, or by providing a QR code to scan</li>
                            <li>The participant completes the survey on her own device, protecting privacy and allowing honest, real-time responses</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="journey-step">
                        <div class="step-number">3</div>
                        <h4>Offline WIC Clinic Visits</h4>
                        <p>Participants have their children's weight and height measurements taken or visit for other ad-hoc needs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Touchpoints don't have to be reliant on staff presence‚Äîparticipants could encounter posters with QR codes</li>
                            <li>Freely available pamphlets or small namecard-size prints of the survey link</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="step-number">4</div>
                        <h4>Grocery Store Touchpoints</h4>
                        <p>As WIC appointments occur a few times across the year, it's important to enable other visibility points that intersect with the benefit of WIC. Featuring an encounter in grocery stores after a participant has redeemed their benefit would be a top of mind moment that can happen on a monthly, or even weekly basis.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <p>This spread-out distribution of touchpoints ensures participants encounter the survey at the exact moment when their experience is top of mind‚Äîmaking feedback more authentic and actionable.</p>
                    
                    <p>In parallel, gentle nudges and touchpoints for staff can be integrated into their regular workflow. As participants receive reminders, staff members are also notified‚Äîcreating a dual-purpose prompt to complete the survey themselves. These reminders every few months are framed as part of an open feedback loop, inviting staff to share their firsthand experiences as front-line workers whose insights are vital to improving the program.</p>
