By mapping the complexities of the WIC ecosystem and surfacing gaps across touchpoints, we identified real opportunities to design for clarity, care, and lasting impact.</p>

                    <h3>Information Gathering</h3>
                    <p>Before meeting our client, we dove into background research to orient ourselves in the world of WIC and WICANYS. We reviewed the WICANYS website, studied the New York State grant narrative, analyzed survey responses, and explored benchmark organizations. Every insight was documented to help us start asking the right questions, even when the boundaries were still unclear.</p>

                    <h3>Initial Challenges</h3>
                    <p>We quickly learned that this problem wasn’t linear. It sat at the intersection of advocacy, access, communications, and care. With a complex network of stakeholders and layers of federal constraints, we were operating in a space where there exists the statement, “we didn’t know what we didn’t know.”</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle-small">Building a Shared Understanding</h3>
                <p>Our kickoff meeting was a crucial moment to compare mental models with the WICANYS team. What did they see as the problem? Where were their pain points most deeply felt? This knowledge transfer revealed important nuances about the system's bottlenecks and opportunities. Together, we built tools like a stakeholder map and a problem matrix to break down the what, who, how, and why.
                </p><br>
                <p>We learned that WICANYS sits in a delicate position: acting as a connector between agencies, participants, and legislators—without always having the tools to streamline those conversations.
